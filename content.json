Data mining, Machine Learning and Music Informatics are the fields I am interested in. \bComputer Science ExperienceHere I provide two examples demonstrating my Computer Science background (Machine Learning). SoundNet Re-implementationRe implement the code for paper “SoundNet: Learning Sound Representations from Unlabeled Video“ by Yusuf Aytar, Carl Vondrick, Antonio Torralba. NIPS 2016 To have a look at our report and our code on github Repeat Buyers Prediction Competition Problem DefinitionMerchants sometimes run big promotions (e.g., discounts or cash coupons) on particular dates (e.g., Boxing-day Sales, “Black Friday” or “Double 11 (Nov 11th)”, in order to attract a large number of new buyers. Unfortunately, many of the attracted buyers are one-time deal hunters, and these promotions may have little long lasting impact on sales. To alleviate this problem, it is important for merchants to identify who can be converted into repeated buyers. By targeting on these potential loyal customers, merchants can greatly reduce the promotion cost and enhance the return on investment (ROI). It is well known that in the field of online advertising, customer targeting is extremely challenging, especially for fresh buyers. However, with the long-term user behavior log accumulated by Tmall.com, we may be able to solve this problem. My friend and I ranked within top 2% in this competition. If you are interested, please check our draft jupyter notebook Music Information Retrieval ExperienceDuring the summer of 2018, I met professor Alexander Lerch, who is from Georgia Tech Center for Music and started an individual ADT project with him. This project aims to detect repetitive rhythm patterns in the activation function and re-weight it to attain a better detection performance. We reached an averaged 15.5% increase for the activation function segment where rhythm patterns are repeated For more information about this project, please check the report link: report on github Music Performance ExperienceI am a\bn amateur drummer, who loves Hard Rock, Blues, J-Pop, etc, with several performance experiences. Here is a record of my band show on campus.If you are interested, please check my YouTube video list for more plays. \bCampus Live shows."},{"title":"Categories","date":"2020-01-14T16:09:57.825Z","updated":"2018-10-04T07:50:27.697Z","comments":true,"path":"categories/index.html","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""},{"title":"Tags","date":"2020-01-14T16:09:57.825Z","updated":"2018-10-04T07:50:27.697Z","comments":true,"path":"tags/index.html","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""}],"posts":[{"title":"周末玩具-旅行团 爵士鼓谱","slug":"周末玩具Drum","date":"2020-01-30T02:25:59.000Z","updated":"2020-01-30T17:16:35.858Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/29/周末玩具Drum/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/29/周末玩具Drum/","excerpt":"","text":"var ap = new APlayer({ element: document.getElementById(\"aplayer-ZcnKYcZx\"), narrow: false, autoplay: false, showlrc: false, music: { title: \"周末玩具\", author: \"旅行团\", url: \"/music/周末玩具.mp3\", pic: \"\", lrc: \"\" } }); window.aplayers || (window.aplayers = []); window.aplayers.push(ap);","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Transcript","slug":"Transcript","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Transcript/"}]},{"title":"流浪王子-怕胖团 爵士鼓谱","slug":"流浪王子Drum","date":"2020-01-30T02:23:53.000Z","updated":"2020-01-30T17:16:40.120Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/29/流浪王子Drum/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/29/流浪王子Drum/","excerpt":"","text":"var ap = new APlayer({ element: document.getElementById(\"aplayer-IzEbEFaf\"), narrow: false, autoplay: false, showlrc: false, music: { title: \"流浪王子\", author: \"怕胖团\", url: \"/music/流浪王子.mp3\", pic: \"\", lrc: \"\" } }); window.aplayers || (window.aplayers = []); window.aplayers.push(ap);","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Transcript","slug":"Transcript","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Transcript/"}]},{"title":"鱼-怕胖团 爵士鼓谱","slug":"fishDrum","date":"2020-01-14T15:45:20.000Z","updated":"2020-01-30T17:16:42.439Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/14/fishDrum/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/01/14/fishDrum/","excerpt":"","text":"var ap = new APlayer({ element: document.getElementById(\"aplayer-sLhNxsXb\"), narrow: false, autoplay: false, showlrc: false, music: { title: \"鱼\", author: \"怕胖团\", url: \"/music/鱼.mp3\", pic: \"\", lrc: \"\" } }); window.aplayers || (window.aplayers = []); window.aplayers.push(ap);","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Transcript","slug":"Transcript","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Transcript/"}]},{"title":"Hello World","slug":"hello-world","date":"2018-10-04T07:32:52.772Z","updated":"2018-10-04T07:32:52.772Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/10/04/hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2018/10/04/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"Welcome to Hexo!
